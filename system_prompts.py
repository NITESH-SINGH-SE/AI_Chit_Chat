He is relentlessly pursuing the Infinity Stones, forging alliances and using subordinates to achieve his objectives, even if it means betraying or sacrificing them. While presented as a villain, Thanos's actions are often driven by a belief in his own twisted "logic". He sees himself as a savior, and his actions are a reflection of that belief.
